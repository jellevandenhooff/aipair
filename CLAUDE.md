# Project Guidelines

## TODO Lists
- When a TODO item is complete, remove it from the list entirely
- Do not mark items as done with strikethrough or checkmarks
- If removing feels wrong (e.g., might want to track what was done), consider if it belongs in commit messages or documentation instead

## Version Control
- This project uses jj (Jujutsu) for version control
- Use `jj describe` to set commit messages
- Use `jj new` to create new changes
